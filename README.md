Hereâ€™s how the game should work!

Game Start: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player doesn't know this number and will try to guess it.

Player Guess: The player enters a guess, and the game checks if it's correct.

Feedback:

If the guess is too high, the game displays a message informing the player.
If the guess is too low, it again informs the player.
If the guess is correct, it congratulates the player and tells them the number of guesses they took.

Hint Mechanic (Optional Twist): Every three incorrect guesses, the game provides a special hint, such as:

The number is odd or even.

Whether the number is in a certain range (like 1-50 or 51-100).

Game Over or Replay Option: Once the player guesses correctly, they get the option to play again or end the game.
